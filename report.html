Report:
While planning this webpage, I wanted to use a simplistic design that wouldn't take any attention away from the content of my page.
I chose a green colour scheme, and created sections for each of my sections.
I then had a table with my skills, alongside an image placed on the right.
I included 4 text sections as follows:
About Me
Future Plans
Reflection
My Design Process
I used an exrernal stylesheet in CSS to keep my main file as uncluttered and organised as I could.
