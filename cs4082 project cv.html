    <div class="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I always had strong passions in many creative fields. As a child I was known by my friends family and teachers for my creativity, and excelled in art and music. I took part in musical performances and won my schools' academic awards for art while I was in primary and secondary education. This is a big reason why MMPT stood out to me as a path to take. The course combines creative fields such as music, film and design with technological aspects which are extremely important to keep up with in this digital age. Throughout my studies I have become more passionate about both music and new interests of mine such as film theory, which I am excited to develop more in a professional setting.</p>

    <div class="future-goals">
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>In the near future, I hope to pursue a work placement in the music or film industry, which will greatly allow me to expand my skill level while also working alongside industry professionals and experiencing the industry environnment. For this placement I would like to travel abroad where the industry is more active and prominent, as I think this will benefit me in both my career and personal development. I also hope to develop my coding skills more in languages such as Python, as they can be applied in several different industries. Finally, I believe there is always more for me to learn in areas such as graphic design and music production, so I plan on consistently continuing to learn more in these fields.</p>

        <h2>Reflection and Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I think this website well represents my jorney so far as a creative and as a student of LM144.</p>
        <p>If I were to expand this webpage, I would likely add a section to showcase some of my projects that I complete throughout my course, to make it feel more like a portfolio.</p>
        <p>Once I have more content to include, there are also some technical changes I would make, such as adding dropdown menus and dark mode. Dropdown menus would aid in my organisation of content as the page becomes more full. Dark mode would be a good option to include as it could improve readability for some users.</p>
